# CTAF Minecraft Modpack
The CTAF Minecraft Modpack originally started as a Vanilla+ modpack for a Minecraft [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC) 1.21.1 server between friends. While the "Vanilla+" aspect is questionable with recent mod additions, this modpack is still used and maintained for that server.

This repository was open-sourced to streamline contributions to the modpack.

This modpack uses [packwiz](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz) to organize and distribute the mods. Please check out their project for the appropriate resources to install and build on this modpack. 

Occasionally, changelogs and old modpack versions can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/slimit75/ctaf-mc-pack/releases) tab in the `.mrpack` format.
